## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Vanilla CSS (no frameworks)
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

While building this QR code component, I learned several important frontend development concepts:

- How to create a mobile-first layout using CSS.
- The difference between semantic and non-semantic HTML elements.
- How to use Flexbox to center items both vertically and horizontally.
- How to structure and link an external CSS file with an HTML document.

Here are a few code snippets I’m proud of:

HTML:

<section class="qr-code-container">
  <img src="./images/image-qr-code.png" alt="QR Code" class="qr-code-image" />
</section>

CSS:
.qr-code-container {
background-color: white;
padding: 1rem;
border-radius: 1rem;
display: flex;
flex-direction: column;
align-items: center;
}

### Useful resources

- **Frontend Mentor** – This helped me understand how to approach real-world frontend challenges. I really liked the way they structure their challenges and will continue using it going forward.
- **MDN Web Docs** – This is an amazing resource which helped me understand various HTML, CSS, and JavaScript concepts in depth. I’d recommend it to anyone still learning frontend development.
